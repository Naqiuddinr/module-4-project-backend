# Tadel (Task Delegation Management App) üìù

Hi! Tadel is my second full-stack project that I build from scratch as part of my Coding Bootcamp requirement to graduate.

Tadel utilised React.js and Node.js. This repo specifically store the code that I wrote for the back-end API endpoint.

+ If you want to see the front end code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Naqiuddinr/module-4-project-tadel)
+ Tadel is also live hosted using vercel, you can try it out [here](https://module-4-project-naqiuddinr.vercel.app/)
+ Since I was required to record a 2 min video for my presentation during the bootcamp, might as well include it [here](https://youtu.be/ynBE71BIlX4?si=n1fPAdOf8rnLZ0uR)
